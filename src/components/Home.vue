      <p>
        MicroHabits can help you track building better habits through small,
        repetitive daily actions. You would be able to set your own goals and
        track them, or work with your friends/family and keep each other
        accountable. The main problem with habit forming/habit breaking is the
        lack of accountability. This app helps to achieve accountability,
        whether used solo or with a partner or group.
